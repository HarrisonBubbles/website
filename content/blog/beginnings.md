It seems like developers are legally obligated to have some sort of blog on their website (whether or not they actually update it), so I figured I would join in on the fun. I don't know what kind of things to write about just yet, so I'll kick things off with the ol' reliable:

```shell
Hello World!
```

Never gets old.
