Hi, I'm Harris! I'm a graduate student at Northeastern University who is endlessly curious about math, computer science, data science, and pretty much everything else. 


Most recently, I worked as a ML Platform Engineer Intern at Xometry. During my undergrad, I worked as an ML Platform Engineer Co-op at Wayfair and as a Full-Stack SWE Co-op at Alignable. 

I am also a **huge** music fan. I love attending local concerts whenever I can and discussing music with others. My top five favorite albums right now are probably:

1. ***The Glow, Pt. 2*** by The Microphones
2. ***Sunbather*** by Deafheaven
3. ***Siamese Dream*** by The Smashing Pumpkins
4. ***Just Got Back From the Discomfort We're Alright*** by Brave Little Abacus
5. ***Weezer*** by Weezer
