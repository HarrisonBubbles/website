Hi, I'm Harris! I'm a graduate student at Northeastern University who is endlessly curious about math, computer science, data science, and pretty much everything else. 


In undergrad, I studied Computer Science and worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer for Wayfair and later for Alignable. With this, as I study math and data science as part of my Masters program, I am excited to see what future work I will take on that can combine my past development experience with my new knowledge.


I am also a **huge** music fan. I love attending local concerts whenever I can and discussing music with others. My top five favorite albums right now are probably:

1. ***The Glow, Pt. 2*** by The Microphones
2. ***Sunbather*** by Deafheaven
3. ***Siamese Dream*** by The Smashing Pumpkins
4. ***Just Got Back From the Discomfort We're Alright*** by Brave Little Abacus
5. ***Weezer*** by Weezer
