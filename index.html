            <br><i class="sub">Computer Science and Mathematics Student, Northeastern University '24</i></br>
            <p class="text">Hi! üëã My name is Harris, and I am a second-year Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University. I am curiosity-driven and love to step outside of my comfort zone. As such, I have tinkered with various facets of the Computer Science world, ranging from software dev to machine leaning.</p>
            <p class="text">Apart from CS, I am also passionate about writing and playing the guitar. I especially love when I do projects that combine my interest for both computers and music! For example, I have recently been using Matlab's signal processing and Fourier transform capabilities to detect musical chords from sound files!</p>

                <li>Use of both statistical and contextual data to examine how the city of Boston handled the COVID crisis compared to other U.S. cities</li>
                <li>Goal of the study was to see, both qualitatively and quantitatively, if Boston could have been doing more to suppress COVID and its consequences</li>
                <li>Used Python, Jupyter, Pandas, and more to analyze data</li>
